## Introduction

**choice justification:** I chose this project to rescue and replicate because it is relevant to my research interests and will allow me to gain skills that I value gaining practice in. My main research interests are in decision making, cognitive control, and how understanding core functions of human cognition can help us better understand potential cognitive differences related to different mental health conditions. Through working on this paper and replicating this experiment, I can gain a better understanding of how generalizing works in the brain and how people make sub-concious decisions about reacting to stimuli and how much to generalize. Additionally, in the past I've worked with JSPsych, on neuroimaging, and on computational experiments, but I have never fully designed or run a behavioral experiment on prolific/MTurk completely on my own. Through doing this project, I hope to expand upon my experimental design and implementation skills.

**stimuli, procedures, and challenges:** For this experiment, I will need to use different frequency noises as stimuli in order to test how valence affects generalization. This will be an online behavioral experiment done on Prolific, and the study includes two stages (acquisition and generalization) that will be interspersed for participants. In the paper, the study also had a second follow up experiment where participants were recalled to do a loss aversion task, in order to understand the loss aversion rate and how it impacts generalization, so I may have to recall the participants to do a second online study as well. I will code/adapt this study in JSPsych and upload it to prolific--this may be a challenge as I've never worked with auditory stimuli before. I will then analyze the data in a similar way to the paper, and will replicate Figures 1 and 2. Finally, I will add attention and manipulation checks to the code (if it isn't already there), and try to identify if there are any errors in the original/replication code that need correcting.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

In the original study, the sample size was 39 (20 m, 19 f), with a median age of 25. I hope to have a sample of around 40 as well. These will be sampled from Prolific (with no specific preselection rules).

### Materials

For this rescue and task, I will need to develop code on prolific for an online task version. This online task will be a behavioral task that uses noises with various frequencies.

### Procedure	

From the paper, and followed precisely: "The experiment consisted of two iterated parts, an acquisition stage—designed to assign valence of gain versus loss to two different tones; and a generalization stage—designed to test differences in the generalization to the two tones. For the acquisition stage, subjects were instructed that in each trial, they would hear one of three tones (300, 500, or 700 Hz, for 200 ms); one tone would gain them money—if they pressed one of two keys after it (termed “positive” tone); one tone would lose them money—unless they pressed the other key after it (termed “negative” tone, because it is a negative reinforcer), and one tone had no outcome independent of what was pressed or not (“neutral”). The key assignment was counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects had to learn by trial-and-error which tone is the positive and which is the negative, and had 2.5 s following the tone presentation to press a key, and then received visual feedback telling them if they earned or lost in the trial. In addition, there were pavlovian trials (classical conditioning), in which the positive tone resulted in gain independent of what was pressed, and the negative tone resulted in loss independent of what was pressed. Subjects were informed by the appearance of the word “helpless” on the screen. The acquisition stage comprised of 24% instrumental negative, 24% instrumental positive, 10% pavlovian negative, 10% pavlovian positive, and 32% neutral. Negative and positive tones were 300 and 700 Hz, counterbalanced across subjects, and the neutral tone was 500 Hz. There were 100 trials overall in the acquisition stages. Three subjects were excluded from subsequent analysis because they did not understand the instructions, as evidenced from their extremely poor behavior. Each loss and gain was of 0.5 Israeli shekels (∼15 US cents).

Participants were informed when the acquisition stage was over and that a new different stage begins. They were not informed in any way that this is a generalization stage or that this is the purpose of the study, and moreover, we questioned the subjects after the experiments and none had an idea that generalization was the task. In this stage, subjects were instructed that there would be many more tones. In each trial, if they hear the positive/negative tone, they should press the same key that was previously associated with it. However, if they hear a tone that is not the exact same tone as either the positive or the negative tone, they should press the “middle” key. They were informed that they would gain money for a correct press (either pressing the appropriate key for a negative or positive tone, or the middle key for a different tone), or lose the same amount for any mistake (pressing the positive/negative keys for a different tone, or the middle key for a positive/negative tone). In this stage, we forced the subject to choose a key and press by imposing a big loss (10 times the amount of regular loss) for no response. There was no feedback reported to the subjects in this generalization stage, to avoid any changes in valence of the tones that was acquired during the acquisition stage.

Notice that although we keep calling the original tones positive/negative tones, these two tones have completely identical requirements and outcomes in this stage and therefore should entail identical decision-making policies. We keep these names for ease and clarity of terminology because they were previously associated with positive/negative outcomes. The generalization stage comprised of 14% of the positive tone, 14% of the negative tone, and 72% of other tones (i.e., that required a press on the middle key). Of these other tones, 14% were “control” tones that are far away from the original tones (80, 100, 100, 120, 480, 500, 500, 520, 880, 900, 900, 920 Hz), and 58% were tones that were closer to the original (positive and negative) tones, [−100, −60, −20, −5, +5, +20, +60, +100] from 300 and 700 Hz. There were 84 trials overall in the generalization stage.

The acquisition and generalization stages appeared three times consecutively in a loop (Fig. 1), to keep the original tones reinforced and avoid extinction effects. Indeed, there was little difference in the response rate for the conditioned tones in the three iterations of the generalization stage (p > 0.1, two-way ANOVA), and no difference in the response rate between each acquisition stage and its consecutive generalization stage (p > 0.1 for all, Wilcoxon rank tests), showing that there were little, if any, extinction effects."

The differences in my rescue procedure from the initial paper procedure are that, in the original paper, they "re-called the same participants and performed the same experiment, with an identical acquisition stage, but this time the generalization stage had tones that are [−100, −60, −20, −5, +5, +20, +60, +100 Hz] around the 500 Hz neutral tone, without the tones surrounding the positive/negative tones" in order to "find the “neutral” generalization curve." I will likely not do this part, as I am not sure if recalling participants is as feasible on prolific.

Another thing I likely will not do (the original replication also didn't do this) but was done in the paper was, "We repeated the experiment with a new set of participants (n = 14), but this time compensating for possible loss-aversion behavior. We tested our subjects for loss-aversion before the experiment (Tom et al., 2007). Each subject was presented with a series of choices of “gaining X money in 0.5 probability and losing Y money in 0.5 probability,” and had to accept/reject the offer. Subjects were told that soon after the test is over the computer would randomly pick a single offer they had accepted and that, following a “virtual coin toss,” they would actually gain or lose the amount of money noted in that particular offer. X and Y were varied over a range of 5–20 to create a matrix of 256 binary choices. We then fitted logistic regressions with accept/reject choices as dependent variables and the size of potential gain and loss as independent variables. The loss aversion was computed as λ= −βloss/βgain, which is similar to loss-aversion in prospect theory with the simplifying common assumptions of linear value function and identical weights for 0.5 probabilities. The median in our subjects (n = 11) was found to be 1.5 and the mean was 1.7, similar to other reports in the literature (Tom et al., 2007; Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009). In the experiment, we chose to use a robust loss-aversion factor of 2 (λ = 2, a gain of twice the loss, i.e., 1 shekel of gain and 0.5 shekel of loss)." Instead, I will potentially use their found loss-aversion factor in my loss aversion analysis.

### Analysis Plan

As stated in the paper: "We used two approaches to quantify the generalization rates for individual subjects, and both yielded highly similar results. First, we measured the drop in response rate per 1 Hz of tone; this is the overall slope of the generalization curve in the range tested in our paradigm (±100 Hz). These slopes were then compared using paired t tests (paired within a subject). We further verified that all comparisons that are reported as significant, were also significant at the same level using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. We used three-way ANOVA to check the effects and interactions of reinforcement type (negative/positive/neutral), the frequency distance (in Hz) from the original tone [0, 5, 20, 60, 100] and the side/direction of the frequency change [higher/lower than the original tone].

Second, because the shape of the generalization curve is nonlinear and is better described by a logistic function, we fitted a multinomial logistic regression for each subject using all single trial (0/1—correct/incorrect) responses. This makes sense because the logistic function reaches a peak plateau at one side (the maximum response at the original tone), and a low plateau (i.e., zero) at the other side (the lowest response at “infinite” distance from the original tone). In this model, the coefficient β1 describes the contribution of the reinforcement type to the response. The higher β1 is, the narrower the generalization curve is. The β1 coefficients of positive and negative data were compared using t tests for each subject, and the p-values were incorporated in Fisher's combined p-value calculation to obtain an overall p-value for the population."

### Differences from Original Study

One difference between my study and the initial study is my likely exclusion of two of their follow-up tasks, as described in the "procedure" section above. In addition, a large difference is that my study will be online (on Prolific), while the initial study was conducted in person. This may make a difference in terms of participant learning/accuracy (if participants are less focused online), as well as a potential difference in the study's sound output (as the entire study revolves around participants detecting various sound frequencies). Finally, the payment structure may be different in my study (depending on if we need to increase the bonus values for Prolific).

```

### Results of Control Measures
how did people perform on any quality control checks or positive and negative controls?

In the initial replication, people took longer to learn in the generalization stage than they did in the original study. As a result, this is something I will look into with my rescue attempt--as well as adding additional attention/manipulation checks.

### Confirmatory analysis

My main confirmatory analysis will be calculating the generalization slope for the participants and comparing the generalization slopes for the previously negative and positive valenced frequencies. As stated in the paper, "First, we measured the drop in response rate per 1 Hz of tone; this is the overall slope of the generalization curve in the range tested in our paradigm (±100 Hz). These slopes were then compared using paired t tests (paired within a subject). We further verified that all comparisons that are reported as significant, were also significant at the same level using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. We used three-way ANOVA to check the effects and interactions of reinforcement type (negative/positive/neutral), the frequency distance (in Hz) from the original tone [0, 5, 20, 60, 100] and the side/direction of the frequency change [higher/lower than the original tone]." In doing so, I hope to confirm whether their initial hypothesis that people will generalize more when the sound was associated with a negative valence, is replicated. If there is a significant difference between the generalization curves, and the negative curve slope is smaller than the positive one, the main ideas behind the original paper's finidngs will be confirmed. Below are the figures I hope to replicate, other than the inclusion of the neutral curves:

## Discussion

### Mini Meta Analysis

### Summary of Replication Attempt

###Summary of Rescue Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  [fill in once I do my own analysis]

####Summary of Prior Replication Attempt**
For the initial replication attempt by Tyler Bonnen in 2018, the interaction between generalization and negative tones was not replicated; instead, there seemed to be greater generalization for positive valenced tones. However, in the initial replication there was also a significant difference in accuracy between positive and negative valence tones--implying participants may not have been properly learning the task. Additionally, for the replication, the learning rate during the acquisition stage was longer than in the original study.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
